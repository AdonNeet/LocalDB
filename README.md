# LocalDB

LocalDB is a simple <sub>(very basic and featherweight)</sub> framework created to simplify the implementation of IndexedDB on a project. LocalDB itself is made to have a feel like using SQL so that there is a query function to get data.
<br /><br />
> Note: for now we are only adding basic features of SQL.
